<div class="title">Webhooks in the ECA Engine</div>
Webhooks are URL's to which other services on the Web will post event data, thus enable the real-time reactive Web.
A Webhook consists of:
<ul>
	<li><kbd>Event Name</kbd>: The name that identifies the event for the user.</li>
	<li><kbd>URL</kbd>: The URL over which remote services will push events into this system.</li>
	<li><kbd>Public/Private flag</kbd>: Whether other users of the system will also be able to receive those events.</li>
</ul>
