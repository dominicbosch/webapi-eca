<div class="title">Event Trigger Schedule</div>
An Event Trigger is a piece of code which is executed according to a certain schedule.<br>

<a href="http://bunkat.github.io/later/parsers.html#text" target="_blank">The schedule needs to be defined in a string of the form as it is explained here.</a><br>

Whenever this piece of code detects a change it should emit an event into the ECA system, using the built-in function <kbd>emitEvent(eventname, obj)</kbd>.
