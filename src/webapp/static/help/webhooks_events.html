<div class="title">Emit Events on Webhooks</div>
<p>
In order to emit an event on a webhook use one <kbd>hookid</kbd> in the list below and emit an event on it by using the built-in function <kbd>emitEvent(hookid, obj)</kbd>, where <kbd>hookid</kbd> is the webhook's ID string and <kbd>obj</kbd> is any arbitrary serializable JSON object.
