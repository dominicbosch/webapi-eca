<div class="title">Program Code</div>

Program Codes can have comments which are also stored with the module.<br>
These comments can help the users of your module to know how to use your module.<br>
They need to start with double slash <kbd>//</kbd> for JavaScript code and only one hash <kbd>#</kbd> for CoffeeScript code.<br>
Only a limited number of functions are available within such programs:
<ul>
	<li><kbd>log(msg)</kbd>: Will add an entry to the log that is accessible through the Rules list. <kbd>msg</kbd> is supposed to be a string and will be truncated after 200 characters.</li>
	<li><kbd>datalog(data)</kbd>: Will add an entry to the data log of the rule. Data logs can be downloaded through the Rules list in a <kbd>JSON</kbd> format.<kbd>data</kbd> is supposed to be in string, number or JSON format.</li>
</ul>
